# AppleII-NaturalLanguageProcessing
Various experiments in parsing and natural language processing in the Forth language for the Apple II

Apple II source code, in the Forth language, related to natural lanuage processing and language parsers, from 1985.

The source was released with the MIT license in 2021 by Lloyd Prentice, the president of Prentice Associates, Inc., the company that produced the software.

I don't know much about this code. Lloyd Prentice, owner of the company, told me: "We hired an MIT intern to develop natural-language code. But it never made its way into production. As I recall, the code is based on algorithms that were popular at the time. As a basis for experimentation, the code worked. But the intern moved on and we were too busy to do anything more with it."
